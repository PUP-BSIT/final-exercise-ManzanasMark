        <h3>Reflection:</h3>

        <p>
            This past few months has been a very interesting experience for me.
            For the three subjects, Web Development, Systems Integration and 
            IT Elective, there were a lot of requirements that we needed to 
            accomplish which means that there are also a lot of new and 
            different things that we must learn in order to complete them.
            Every week there were two things that was always on my mind, and I
            think most of my classmates too. These were the recitation that we'd
            have before the start and the 1 hour hands on activity at the end of
            every Web Development class. I'd try my best to prepare for both but
            at first I was a bit overwhelemed because there were so many new
            information that we needed to learn and understand. The more time
            that passed the more I got accustomed to it. I'd sleep during Friday
            afternoon and wake up at around midnight so that I'd have time to
            wait for the presentation for the class tomorrow in order to do
            some advanced reading. Me and my classmates would also study during 
            break time at the library before the start of our Web Development 
            class.
        </p>

        <p>
            I experienced a lot stress while working on the different tasks 
            we were assigned, like the project and the exercises. I also 
            experienced great satisfaction whenever I am able to overcome the 
            problems and challenges that I've encountered while coding. I'd 
            spend hours and sometimes even days just trying so figure out why 
            a certain part of my code doesn't work and nothing beats the 
            I never expected it to be easy, but I also didn't have an idea on 
            how difficult it would be. satisfaction I felt whenever I was able 
            to overcome them. Now knowing what it's like in the IT industry, I 
            have no regrets and still intend on continuing my career in IT 
            because the more difficult something is, the higher the amount of
            value that is held within it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            5 years from now I see myself working as a game developer working
            at a game development company. I've always loved playing video games
            ever since I was little. Nothing beats the joy I felt during those
            times. It is also one of the reasons why I chose IT so that I can 
            learn how a video game is developed. My plan is to combine my skills
            in coding and passion for video games to create educational video 
            games that students of any age can benefit from. There a already
            a lot of existing educational games although there are things
            you can learn from them, the majority of those types of games are
            very boring and not fun enough to convince a child to continue
            playing them. My plan is to find the right balance between the 2 of
            being educational and still being very enjoyable to play. I got This
            idea because when I play games I also consider what the game can
            help me develop. Like for example rhythm games help develop my
            reaction time and hand eye coordination. Puzzle games help me think
            outside the box. Strategy games help develop my problem solving 
            skills and many more. I chose IT because I know that there is a lot
            of money that can be made under this profession and support my 
            family, but I would also like to be able to help other people with
            my coding skills and expertise.
