        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="bold-text">Martial Arts</li>
            ----------------
            <p> - I was introduced to martial arts when I was just 3 years old
                  and I still attend martial arts classes
                  to this day. I also have competed in 
                  tournaments both nationally and internationally</p>
            <li class="bold-text">Basketball</li> 
            ---------------
            <p> - When I was younger, I didn't like playing basketball at all.
                  I only started liking it as a hobby about 2 years ago 
                  when I had nothing to do due to the pandemic. </p>
            <li class="bold-text">Playing video games</li>
            ------------------------------
            <p> - I've loved playing video games ever since I was a child.
                  From relaxing sandbox games to competitive
                  FPS games, I've played a lot of them. </p>
            <li class="bold-text">Learning new languages</li>
            -----------------------------------
            <p> - I'm currently studying the japanese language and after that
                  I plan on learning Russian language</p>
            <li class="bold-text">Swimming</li>
            ---------------
            <p> - I only started to like swimming because my parents enrolled
                  me to a swimming class during summer
                  vacation when I was little. By the end of summer,
                  I improved to a point where I was able to join swimming
                  competitions, I still enjoy swimming to this day
                  but I no longer swim competitively.
            </p>
